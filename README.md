# Nested-JSON-Data-Analysis-with-Snowflake

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I delved into the realm of social media data analysis using Snowflake, focusing on processing nested JSON data from Twitter. The goal was to create a robust pipeline for ingesting, querying, and analyzing Twitter data within the Snowflake environment.

**Key Tasks:**

Database Setup: Created "SOCIAL_MEDIA_FLOODGATES" for efficient Twitter data management.
Table Creation: Established "TWEET_INGEST" for structured storage and seamless querying.
File Format Configuration: Optimized JSON format for Twitter data compatibility.
Data Ingestion: Uploaded "nutrition_tweets.json" into "TWEET_INGEST" using predefined format.
Querying and Analysis: Executed SQL queries to extract tweet entities, hashtags, and more.
Data Transformation: Implemented techniques to streamline processing and enhance readability.

**Deployment Process:**
Ensured Snowflake readiness, initialized database and table, configured file format, ingested data, and executed queries for analysis.

**Project Outcome:**
This project not only provided hands-on experience in working with nested JSON data within Snowflake but also enhanced proficiency in database management, SQL querying, and data analysis techniques. The structured approach to data handling ensures scalability and efficiency, laying the groundwork for future data-driven endeavors.
